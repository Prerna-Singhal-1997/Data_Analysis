Why or why not?**\n","\n","The CART model could somewhat be useful in detecting Wikipedia vandalism, achieving a test accuracy of about 75%. Key variables, such as whether a user was logged in, show quite strong correlations with vandalism—logged-out edits, for example, often coincide with suspicious behavior, aligning with the observation that anonymous edits can sometimes be problematic. Other features like the presence of HTTP links are less strongly correlated. However, the model has limitations. It may miss complex forms of vandalism that do not fit the identified patterns. Although setting min_samples_leaf to 10 optimized the model, CART would most likely show the best results as an underlying part of a larger system, using complementary approaches such as natural language processing or anomaly detection algorithms, which could catch all of the more tacit cases that may arise and further enhance its reliability. This would give a more holistic approach by considering the diversity in vandalism behaviors on Wikipedia increasing the robustness of this model."],"metadata":{"id":"M5nb5aEYNiH5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["(ii) **If you could collect more data about the edits, what variables would you want?

Do you think this model would easily extend to other pages? Why or why not?**\n","\n","The model may have limited generalizability to other Wikipedia pages as characteristics of editing patterns can vary significantly across different topics. For instance, compared to other niche topics, high-profile or controversial topics may be vulnerable to sophisticated and more varied vandalism methods. Specific terms and editing behaviors indicative of vandalism on the \"Language\" page may not be relevant elsewhere. The model can be much more generalizable with retraining or adaptation with diverse training data, including a wide variety of edits on Wikipedia pages. That would provide the correct relevance in different contexts."],"metadata":{"id":"pOHSKTP_pjZu"}}]}
